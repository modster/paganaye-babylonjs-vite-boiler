# [BabylonJs + vite Boilerplate](https://github.com/modster/paganaye-babylonjs-vite-boiler)

## Live [Demo](https://greeffer.com/paganaye-babylonjs-vite-boiler/)

## Description

This is a [BabylonJS](https://babylonjs.com) & [Vite](https://vite.com) minimal boilerplate with [Typescript](https://typescript.com) support.

## Getting Started:

- clone or download the repo
- `npm install`
- For development: `npm run dev`
- For production: `npm run build` then to preview what was built `npm run preview`

## Development mode and debugging

First `npm run dev`
Then in vscode press F5, otherwise just open a browser at http://localhost:3000/

## Production build

First `npm run build`
A `dist` folder is created and contains the distribution.
You can `npm run preview` it on your development machine.
Production preview runs at http://localhost:5000/ . The terminal will display external URLs if you want to test from a phone or tablet.

## File Structure

### /index.html

This file is used as a template by vite to create the actual **index.html** that will be served to the client.

### /public

This folder contains your html asset. The files in this folder are served by the test webserver as root files.

### /src

This is where you should place all your application code.

### /src/main.ts

This is the entry point of the app.

### /src/AppOne.ts

A sample app that copy the code from the babylon.js playground.
